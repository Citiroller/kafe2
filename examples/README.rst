This directory contains examples for *kafe2*:
files that illustrate how to use *kafe2* for various use cases.
Because *kafe2* is intended as a tool for beginners these examples don't get into too much technical detail.
For a more detailed explanation for why things are the way they are consult the files in the *case_studies* directory.

A quick overview of the examples available:

* **001_line_fit**: Fitting a line to *xy* data points with some uncertainties in the *x* and *y* direction.
* **002_model_function2**: How to specify custom model functions.
* **003_constraints**: How to specify constraints for model parameters.
* **004_non_linear_fit**: Considerations for handling non-linear fits.
* **005_hitogram_fit**: How to bin one-dimensional data and fit a probability distribution.
* **006_unbinned_fit**: How to fit a probability distribution to data without binning it.
* **101_complicated_errors**: How to specify uncertainties as a covariance matrix.
* **102_multifit**: How to handle several fits using the same parameters.
* **202_cost_functions**: How to define cost functions other than chi squared.

All examples are available as both Python scripts and YAML files intended for *kafe2go*.
In this directory there are also Jupyter notebooks that cover the same topics as the examples in a more tutorial-like way.
The Jupyter notebooks are available both in German and in English.
