# Example 01: Line fit
# In this example a line f(x) = a * x + b is being fitted
# to some data points with pointwise uncertainties

# The minimal keywords needed to perform a fit are x_data and y_data.
# Usually you will also want to define x_errors and y_errors

# Data is defined by lists:
x_data: [1.0, 2.0, 4.0]

# For errors lists describe pointwise uncertainties.
# By default the errors will be uncorrelated.
x_errors: [0.05, 0.1, 0.2]

# In total the following x data will be used for the fit:
# x_0: 1.0 +- 0.1
# x_1: 2.0 +- 0.2
# x_2: 4.0 +- 0.4

# In yaml lists can also be written out like this:
y_data:
- 2.3
- 4.2
- 9.4

# The above is equivalent to
# y_data: [2.3, 4.2, 9.4]

# For errors a single float gives each data point
# the same amount of uncertainty:
y_errors: 0.5

# The above is equivalent to
# y_errors: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]

# In total the following y data will be used for the fit:
# y_0: 2.3 +- 0.5
# y_1: 4.2 +- 0.5
# y_2: 9.4 +- 0.5
